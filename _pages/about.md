<h3>Hey there, I'm Boyu Ma ðŸŒŸ</h3>
<p align = "justify"> 
  I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. Before this, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in October 2024, and my B.S. in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing and Automation from Yanshan University (YSU), Qinhuangdao, China, in June 2019.
</p> 
<p align = "justify"> 
I am currently working with <a href="https://marsyang.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Assistant Prof. Jianfei Yang</a> on <em>Embodied AI</em> at the <a href="https://marslab.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">NTU MARS Lab</a>, exploring research topics in <em>robotics & AI</em>, including robot learning, robotic dexterous grasping, dual-arm collaborative manipulation, humanoid robots, foundation model-driven robotics, and diffusion policy.
</p>
<p align = "justify"> 
Before joining UH, I completed a two-year postdoctoral research program supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mvImZ_oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Qinghua Huang</a> at PKU in 2023.
