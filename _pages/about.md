<h3>Hey there, I'm Boyu Ma 🌟</h3>
<p align = "justify"> 
  I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I am currently working with Assistant Prof. <a href="https://marsyang.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Jianfei Yang</a> on <em>Embodied AI</em> at the <a href="https://marslab.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">NTU MARS Lab</a>, exploring research topics in <em>Robotics & AI</em>, including robot learning, robotic dexterous grasping, dual-arm collaborative manipulation, humanoid robots, foundation model-driven robotics, etc.
</p> 
<p align = "justify"> 
Before joining NTU, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (specialized in Robotics) at the State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in October 2024, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/xiezongwu?lang=zh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Zongwu Xie</a> and co-supervision of Prof. <a href="https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/jiangzainan?lang=zh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Zainan Jiang</a>, in the research lab led by Prof. <a href="https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/liuhong?lang=zh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Hong Liu</a> (Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering & Vice President of HIT & Director of Chinese State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems). During my Ph.D. studies, I also closely collaborated with Associate Profs. <a href="https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/liuyanghit?lang=zh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Yang Liu</a> and <a href="https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/caobaoshi?lang=zh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Baoshi Cao</a>. Earlier, I received my B.S. in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing and Automation (specialized in Mechatronic Engineering) from Yanshan University (YSU), Qinhuangdao, China, in June 2019.
