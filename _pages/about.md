<h3>Hey there, I'm Boyu Ma ðŸŒŸ</h3>
<p align = "justify"> 
  I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I am currently working with Assistant Prof. <a href="https://marsyang.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Jianfei Yang</a> on <em>Embodied AI</em> at the <a href="https://marslab.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">NTU MARS Lab</a>, exploring research topics in <em>Robotics & AI</em>, including robot learning, robotic dexterous grasping, dual-arm collaborative manipulation, humanoid robots, foundation model-driven robotics, and diffusion policy.

Before joining NTU, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in October 2024, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/xiezongwu?lang=zh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Zongwu Xie</a> and co-supervision of Prof. <a href="https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/jiangzainan?lang=zh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Zainan Jiang</a>, in the research lab led by Prof. <a href="https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/liuhong?lang=zh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Hong Liu</a> (Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering & Vice President of HIT). During my Ph.D. studies, I also closely collaborated with Associate Profs. <a href="https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/liuyanghit?lang=zh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Yang Liu</a> and <a href="https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/caobaoshi?lang=zh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;">Baoshi Cao</a>. Earlier, I received my B.S. in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing and Automation (specialized in Mechatronic Engineering) from Yanshan University (YSU), Qinhuangdao, China, in June 2019.
